title: Discord Bot!!
---

I'm working on a discord bot. I've made a lot of progress so far, but I have yet to even come close to a finished bot. I hope I get there at some point though!

I'm using discord.js for the API wrapper, which I've used before. I want to make it public eventually, but for now, it'll be confined to my private server. I'm only doing this because I don't have a place to host it yet, but I will soon, hopefully. In the meantime, I'd suggest that you clone it and use it yourself if you have the ability. 

Clone it at [triplrrr/dnd-management-bot](https://github.com/triplrrr/dnd-management-bot)!
