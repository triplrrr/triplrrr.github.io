title: Learning how to use Django
---

I've been working on getting Django working on REPL.it, but REPL doesn't seem to be the best platform for it, unfortunately. I like to use REPL because it's easy and web apps deploy automatically on their server. It seems to be the easiest way to test and run stuff, though doesn't seem great for production. 

Regardless, I continue to try. I also got a demo of [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) and [marked.js](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) working with eachother on a static site, since I could only find a demo for server side. Check that out [here](https://marked-test.triplrrr.repl.co/)!

Anyways, I've been busy with school, so not much has gone up here. I'll try to update this blog more fequently. Bye!
